Red Black trees implemented in Haskell based on the paper by Chris Okasaki. Visualization using the Gloss library.

## Building

Compile with `stack build`

Run with `stack run`

## Instructions

Type in a space seperated list of integers:

`> 7 4 8 3`

and watch a not so pretty animation of the tree being built up insertion by insertion
